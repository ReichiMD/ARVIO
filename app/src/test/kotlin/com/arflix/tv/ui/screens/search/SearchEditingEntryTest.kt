/**
 * Device report 15.09.2026, seen twice and reproduced by the user: opening the search screen on
 * a TV left the ring in the search bar with no keyboard on screen, every direction key dead and
 * only BACK getting out. The screen had come up in typing mode, switched on by the very press
 * that opened it and handed on to the new screen.
 *
 * The guard against it was half built — the window was opened on entry and never asked about.
 * These tests ask it: the doors into typing mode are modelled here exactly as `SearchScreen`
 * uses them, so what is checked is the real decision, not a copy of it.
